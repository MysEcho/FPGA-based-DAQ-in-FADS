This project introduces an innovative approach to
data acquisition utilizing FPGA technology, focusing on real-time
peak detection and storage. The centerpiece of the study is the
design and implementation of a custom Sampling module for
peak detection within an FPGA-based Data Acquisition System.
The Sampling module is characterized by its ability to discern
input signal variations against a user-specified threshold. Upon
detection of a peak in the input signal, the module triggers a
precise sampling process and archives the captured data within
the FPGAâ€™s Block RAM. The paper also emphasizes adaptability
by enabling users to define the number of samples for each peak
and the total number of peaks desired.
